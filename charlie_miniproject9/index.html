      <p class="lyrics">
        Oh, they say people come<br>
        Say people go<br>
        This particular diamond was extra special<br>
        And though you might be gone<br>
        And the world may not know<br>
        Still I see you, celestial<br>
        <br>
        Like a lion you ran<br>
        A goddess you rolled<br>
        Like an eagle you circle<br>
        In perfect purple<br>
        So how come things move on?<br>
        How come cars don't slow?<br>
        When it feels like the end of my world<br>
        When I should, but I can't, let you go?<br>
        <br>
        But when I'm cold, cold<br>
        Oh, when I'm cold, cold<br>
        There's a light that you give me<br>
        When I'm in shadow<br>
        There's a feeling you give me, an <span id="everglow">everglow</span><br>
        <br>
        Like brothers in blood<br>
        Sisters who ride<br>
        And we swore on that night<br>
        We'd be friends 'til we die<br>
        But the changing of winds<br>
        And the way waters flow<br>
        Life is short as the falling of snow<br>
        And now I'm gonna miss you, I know<br>
        <br>
        But when I'm cold, cold<br>
        In water rolled, salt<br>
        I know that you're always with me<br>
        And the way you will show<br>
        And you're with me wherever I go<br>
        And you give me this feeling<br>
        This <span id="everglow">everglow</span><br>
        <br>
        Oh, what I would give for just a moment to hold<br>
        Yeah, I live for this feeling, it's <span id="everglow">everglow</span><br>
        <br>
        So if you love someone<br>
        You should let them know<br>
        <span id="everglow">Oh, the light that you left me will everglow</span><br>

      <p>Lyrics:</p>

      <p class="lyrics">
        When you try your best, but you don't succeed<br>
        When you get what you want, but not what you need<br>
        When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep<br>
        Stuck in reverse<br>
        <br>
        And the tears come streaming down your face<br>
        When you lose something you can't replace<br>
        When you love someone, but it goes to waste<br>
        Could it be worse?<br>
        <br>
        Lights will guide you home<br>
        And ignite your bones<br>
        And I will try to <span id="fixyou">fix you</span><br>
        <br>
        And high up above, or down below<br>
        When you're too in love to let it go<br>
        But if you never try, you'll never know<br>
        Just what you're worth<br>
        <br>
        Lights will guide you home<br>
        And ignite your bones<br>
        And I will try to <span id="fixyou">fix you</span><br>
        <br>
        Tears stream down your face<br>
        When you lose something you cannot replace<br>
        Tears stream down your face, and I<br>
        Tears stream down your face<br>
        I promise you I will learn from my mistakes<br>
        Tears stream down your face, and I<br>
        <br>
        <span id="fixyou">Lights will guide you home<br>
        And ignite your bones<br>
        And I will try to fix you</span>
